## Hi there 👋

I'm a Depressed Developer. I make videos on YouTube about my project and my mental health (cool subjects, I know). I want to share my experiences, fun, projects, and talk about that taboo subject that is mental health (in general.)
Developer is not the best job for mental health as you may probably know, that's why I'm convinced we should talk more about it and not be afraid of this subject!
Plus, I'm using these videos to improve my English speaking...
